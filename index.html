            <p>In the Land of Code, Castles, and Rock

                In the realm where websites grow,
                Where HTML and CSS flow,
                There’s a coder with a rockin' dream,
                Crafting sites that always gleam.
                
                With Sophie and Bella by Val’s side,
                Two loyal pups full of pride,
                They bark and play as the code takes shape,
                A masterpiece no bug can escape.
                
                Queen’s anthems play loud and true,
                As Val codes the night straight through,
                "Bohemian Rhapsody" on repeat,
                While a hearty meatloaf’s ready to eat.
                
                In a castle high with towers tall,
                Val’s code stands strong, won’t let it fall.
                A kingdom built with careful thought,
                Where every function, every loop is caught.
                
                And when the day’s work is all done,
                It’s Star Wars time, just for fun.
                Lightsabers flash in a galaxy far,
                As Val dreams of code under a bright star.
                
                So here’s to Val, with passions so wide,
                From coding and castles to pups by your side.
                Rocking the web, with Queen in the air,
                Building a world with love and care.</p>
